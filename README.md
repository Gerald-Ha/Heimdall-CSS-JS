# Heimdall-CSS-JS

## Overview

This repository contains custom CSS and JavaScript settings for Heimdall.

### Features

- **JavaScript**: The script divides the categories in Heimdall into two containers. Container 1 is positioned at the top and contains specifically defined categories. Container 2 automatically includes all other categories not listed in Container 1.
- **CSS**: Customizations for improved display of containers and categories.

### Setup

1. **Bookmark Tags**: Ensure your bookmarks in Heimdall are categorized according to the created tags. These tags act as categories that will be displayed in their respective containers.
2. **Settings**: Go to the Heimdall settings and select "Categories" under "Treat Tags as". This is necessary for the JavaScript code to function correctly.

### Installation

2. Update your Heimdall configuration according to the provided instructions.

### Notes

- Ensure all categories and tags are correctly defined to guarantee proper display and functionality.
